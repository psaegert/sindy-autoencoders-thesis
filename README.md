# On Data-Driven Discovery Of Symbolic Differential Equations From Unsuitable Coordinates Using SINDy-Autoencoders

## Abstract

"Machine Learning Methods have evolved to a powerful tool in many fields of science, including physics. While methods have become fast and sophisticated enough to learn a wide variety of tasks, they often come at the cost of interpretability. This problem can be partially overcome by making use of symbolic regression as shown in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1517384113">[1]</a> and <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/c9f2f917078bd2db12f23c3b413d9cba-Paper.pdf">[2]</a>, but it requires data in suitable coordinates. In my work, I assess and improve the SINDY-Autoencoder proposed by K. Champion et al. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02107">[3]</a>, which is designed to learn not only symbolic equations of motion from high-dimensional data, but also the coordinates in which the equations would be most conveniently formulated. I conduct a verification and replication of the proposed method before creating and evaluating variants which eventually lead to better and more reliable results."
